     * RECOMMENDED: Be agnostic about the code that was written for the class
     * that you are testing. Write all the tests that you think you'll need,
     * in order to test the BalancedBrackets class FIRST, without looking at
     * the code in the BalancedBrackets.java directly; all that you need to
     * know in order to write a good test is knowing what the code is supposed
     * to do.
     *
     * Write the tests; run them; and THEN compare the code in the class that
     * you were testing with your tests, to find out whether the class, the
     * tests, or both need fixing.
     *
     * ABOUT THE CLASS BalancedBrackets....
     *
     * The function BalancedBrackets should return true if and only if
     * the input string has a set of "balanced" brackets.
     *
     * That is, whether it consists entirely of pairs of opening/closing
     * brackets (in that order), none of which mis-nest. We consider a bracket
     * to be square-brackets: [ or ].
     *
     * The string may contain non-bracket characters as well.
     *
